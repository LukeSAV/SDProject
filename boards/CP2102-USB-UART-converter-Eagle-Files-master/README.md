[CP2102 USB to UART adapter(100033)](https://e-radionica.com/en/usb-uart-adapter-with-cp2102-made-by-e-radionica.html)

## Description and details
This little adapter converts USB communication to UART using Silabs CP2102. Everything is packed on a small board. In addition to standard UART pins arranged in standard order: DTR, RXD, TXD, VCC, CTS, GND, other pins from the chip are available on the board: RST, Suspend, Suspend ', RI, DCD, DSR, RTS, CTS.

In addition, the board is a voltage regulator and a switch, it is possible to determine the output voltage of 3.3V or 5V, depending on the device you are using. Logic UART signal is always 3.3V, but do not worry, 5V devices will work without problems. There are also three LEDs, one for power indicator and one for each direction of UART communication.
 
- Dimensions: 25 x 35 mm
- USB - UART bridge: CP2102
- Input voltage: 5V (USB)
- Output voltage: 3.3V ili 5V
- Logic of UART signal: 3.3V

## Repository content
This repo contains Cadsoft Eagle .sch and .brd files for CO2102 breakout. It also contains schematic in .pdf created from .sch Eagle file. 
Files have been arranged into folders for navigating between different versions of board. 
Tip: layer 200 shows top silkscreen and layer 208 should be bottom silkscreen. tParts and bParts layers are not used in actual PCB.
